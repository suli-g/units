# Unit Converter

The **Unit Converter** is a Django application designed to handle unit conversions. It allows you to define base units and implement subunits that extend those base units. You can create items measured with these units and easily change and convert properties between subunits.

## Features

1. **Base Units and Subunits:**

    - Define base units (e.g., meters, kilograms, seconds) and their corresponding subunits (e.g., centimeters, grams, milliseconds).
    - Each subunit extends a base unit, inheriting its properties and conversion rules.
2. **Item Creation:**

    - Create items (e.g., physical quantities, measurements) associated with specific units.
    - Specify the value and unit for each item (e.g., 10 meters, 500 grams).
3. **Conversion:**

    - Convert properties between subunits seamlessly.
    - Example: Convert 100 centimeters to meters or 2 kilograms to grams.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:**

    - Clone this repository.
    - Install Django and any necessary dependencies.
2. **Define Units:**

    - In your Django models, define base units and subunits.
    - Implement conversion methods for each subunit.
3. **Create Items:**

    - Use the Django admin interface or custom forms to create items.
    - Associate each item with a specific unit.
4. **Conversion Logic:**

    - Implement logic to convert between subunits.
    - Provide user-friendly APIs for conversion.

## Usage

1. **Create Items:**

    - Add items with their values and associated units.
    - Example: Create an item with 5 meters.
2. **Convert Properties:**

    - Use the conversion logic to change properties between subunits.
    - Example: Convert 100 centimeters to meters.
